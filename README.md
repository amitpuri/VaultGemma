### Chat Interface

```python
from vaultgemma import ModelManager, TextGenerator

manager = ModelManager()
provider = manager.load_model("google/vaultgemma-1b")
generator = TextGenerator(provider)

# Chat with context
messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful AI assistant."},
