### 3. Intent Recognition Evaluator (`intent_evaluator.py`)
**Intent categories tested:**
- Information seeking
- Problem solving
- Decision making
- Action requests
- Confirmations
- Complaints and praise
- Clarification requests

**Entity types extracted:**
- Person names, organizations, locations
- Contact information (email, phone)
- Dates, times, financial data
- URLs, products, job titles

**Scoring Criteria:**
- Intent recognition accuracy (40%)
- Entity extraction accuracy (30%)
- Response relevance (20%)
- Structured output (10%)

### 4. Sentiment Analysis Evaluator (`sentiment_evaluator.py`)
**Sentiment types tested:**
- Positive, negative, neutral sentiment
- Mixed sentiment detection
- Sarcasm and irony recognition
- Business communication sentiment
- Social media sentiment
- Product review analysis

**Scoring Criteria:**
- Sentiment accuracy (40%)
- Intensity detection (25%)
- Emotion recognition (20%)
- Context understanding (15%)

### 5. Entity Extraction Evaluator (`entity_evaluator.py`)
**Entity types extracted:**
- Person names and job titles
- Organizations and companies
- Locations and addresses
- Contact information (email, phone)
- Dates, times, financial data
- URLs, products, industry classifications

**Scoring Criteria:**
- Entity extraction accuracy (50%)
- Entity type classification (25%)
- Completeness (15%)
- Format consistency (10%)

### 6. Evaluation Runner (`evaluation_runner.py`)
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Run all evaluators or specific ones
- **Command Line Interface**: Full CLI with configuration options
- **Results Aggregation**: Overall summary with recommendations
- **Performance Tracking**: Execution time and resource usage
- **Detailed Reporting**: JSON output with actionable insights

## Key Features

### Business Context Enhancement
- **Enterprise Scenarios**: Real-world business challenges and decision-making
- **Professional Tone**: Business-appropriate language and structure
- **Actionable Insights**: Focus on practical recommendations and next steps
- **Quantitative Analysis**: Financial metrics, timelines, and measurable outcomes

### Advanced Prompt Engineering
- **Context-Rich Prompts**: Detailed business scenarios with specific constraints
- **Role-Based Testing**: CEO, CFO, CTO, and other executive perspectives
- **Industry-Specific**: Technology, healthcare, finance, and other sectors
- **Multi-Stakeholder**: Customer, employee, and investor viewpoints

### Comprehensive Scoring
- **Multi-Dimensional**: Multiple scoring criteria for each evaluator
- **Weighted Metrics**: Balanced scoring based on importance
- **Detailed Breakdown**: Individual metric scores for analysis
- **Pass/Fail Thresholds**: Clear success criteria (70% threshold)

### Robust Testing Framework
- **40+ Test Cases**: Comprehensive coverage across all domains
- **Real-World Scenarios**: Practical business situations
- **Edge Cases**: Complex, ambiguous, and challenging prompts
- **Performance Metrics**: Execution time and resource usage tracking

## Usage Examples

### Quick Start
```bash
# Run all evaluations
python -m evals.evaluation_runner --model google/vaultgemma-1b

# Run specific evaluator
python -m evals.evaluation_runner --evaluator business

# Custom configuration
python -m evals.evaluation_runner --max-tokens 500 --temperature 0.8
```

### Python API
```python
from evals import BusinessEvaluator, EvaluationRunner

# Individual evaluator
evaluator = BusinessEvaluator(model_name="google/vaultgemma-1b")
summary = evaluator.run_evaluation()

# All evaluators
runner = EvaluationRunner(model_name="google/vaultgemma-1b")
results = runner.run_all_evaluations()
```

## Output and Reporting

### Individual Results
- JSON files with detailed test results
- Score breakdowns by metric
- Execution times and performance data
- Pass/fail status for each test

### Overall Summary
- Aggregated scores across all evaluators
- Pass rates and performance trends
- Actionable recommendations
- Model performance insights

### Recommendations Engine
- Performance-based suggestions
- Improvement areas identification
- Configuration optimization tips
- Best practices guidance

## Integration with Existing Code

The evaluation framework integrates seamlessly with the existing VaultGemma codebase:

- **Uses Existing Classes**: ModelManager, TextGenerator, ModelConfig, GenerationConfig
- **Consistent API**: Follows the same patterns as existing code
- **Modular Design**: Can be used independently or as part of larger systems
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new evaluators and test cases
